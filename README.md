# Binovation

## Project Description
This repository contains Arduino programs for our MyScience project "Binovation". The Bin Sensor is designed to measure the height of the garbage inside a bin over a period of time that is triggered via button press. It then sends the measurements to the Serial console, which then can be inserted into the Binovation Website.

## Installation
To use the Bin Sensor project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Binovation.git
    ```

2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.

3. Open the Arduino IDE.

4. Open the `V5 deepsleep_final.ino` file from the cloned repository in the Arduino IDE.

5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

6. Click on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino board.

7. Open the Serial console in the Arduino IDE to view the measurements sent by the Bin Sensor.

8. The Bin Sensor is now ready to measure the height of the garbage in the bin.
